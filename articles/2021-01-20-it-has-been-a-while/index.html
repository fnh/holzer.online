<h1>It's been a while...</h1>

<p>
Many, many years ago, I maintained a website.
It was fun.
Then life got in the way, domains expired, and that site fell into oblivion.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I made a profession out of what was once my hobby.
Earning one's bread doing what one would have gladly pursued free, for passion is a privilege granted to
only a fraction of the human race, as Fred Brooks rightfully stated in the epilogue of his seminal
<i><a href="/references/mythical-man-month/">Mythical Man-Month</a></i>.
So, by and large, I consider myself a very lucky man.
</p>
<p>
Yet, over the years I lost track of the passion, the fun aspect slipped away a bit.
This, therefore, is an attempt at rekindling it.
For now, in the shape of a single file, filled with random musings of some <a href="https://rakhim.org/images/honestly-undefined/blogging.jpg"> weird dude who writes raw HTML</a>.
</p>
<p>
Just for the fun of it. <i>:)</i>
