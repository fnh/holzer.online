Happy new year - Let's bring back blogging in 2023
</h1>

<p>
New year's resolutions tend to not really work out for me, so I consider the following to be a resolution I only incidentally take on the first day of this new year. 
</p>
<p>
I love personal websites (as opposed to the corporate web) and the idea of <a href="https://bringback.blog">Bring Back Blogging</a> resonated strongly with me. I just signed up to it. The project: publishing three articles in January (+an announcement at the beginning and the end) and providing a RSS feed for the site. 
</p>
<p>
So this is the announcement of the beginning. I'll keep it  short, and will use the rest of the evening to get my RSS feed generation script in order again.
