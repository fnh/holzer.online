Is blogging back?
</h1>
<p>
At the end of last year I came across the <a href="https://bringback.blog/">Bring Back Blogging</a> initiative of Ash Huang and Ryan Putnam. I think it was a terrific idea to commit to some activity on my personal website in the month of January, and apparently more than 500 other people thought so as well.

<p>
The web, with its not quite 2<sup>5</sup> years of existence, is still a young medium. Blogging as one of its archetypical forms hasn't actually been away. Yet, that the web is an open platform is so not through a law of nature. Given the economical and political circumstances of surveillance capitalism, and the maddening drift to authoritarian forms of governance, those properties would better not be taken for granted.

<p>
But that is all the more a reason to experiment, tinker and shape the medium through usage and many more <a href="https://notes.ashsmash.com/entries/bringbackblogsomg/">cute little experiments</a>, and do what is possible to increase the signal-noise ratio of the better corners of the web.
