Introducing a blogroll
</h1>

<p>
I've just added a <a href="/blogroll/">blogroll</a> to my website. I've postponed this task for so long, because - as often - of  my time budget didn't fit my ambition. I wanted to comment every entry,  pick out my favorite article(s) for each site, find proper categories, and offer it alternatively as OPML file to be imported into a feedreader.
</p>

<p>
I did nothing like that (yet), just another site with a little over a dozend links, in no particular order, to mostly personal blogs and websites, which I read and of which think other people might like them as well. But at least, now something exists, to which I can <a href="/articles/on-digital-gardening/">tend to, when the time budget permits</a>.
