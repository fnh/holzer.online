Adding dark mode
</a>
</h1>

<p>
At the risk of losing a lot of nerd cred: I, by and large, prefer light mode. But I'm not dogmatic about it.
</p>

<p>
Media queries make it very easy to detect the readers preference and CSS custom properties help keeping the rest of the styling clean and non-repetitive. So I thought it would be a right neighbourly thing to add the following:
</p>

<style>
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --main-bg-color: black;
    --main-text-color: #999;
    --article-bg-color: black;
    --article-code-bg-color: #888;
    --article-code-text-color: #F5F3F3;
  }
}
</style>

<p>
It looks plausible to me, but visual design isn't my strongest suit. So if someone, who prefers dark mode, has thoughts on it, I'd be thrilled to <a href="/contact.html">hear from you</a>.
