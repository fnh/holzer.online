Preserving the web is an unsolved problem 
</a>
</h1>

<p>
No website is guaranteed to exist for ever, not even for a timespan that significantly outlives its original author. Keeping one up and running is, although very cheap, not entirely free. But even loss-leader offerings like github pages or the aws free tier are payed for by somebody. And that somebody might stop doing so for many reasons. 
</p>

The web is a young medium, yet in the three decades an incredible amount of content has been created and discussed on it. Some of which had deep and lasting impact. Yet, there is a high risk that a lot of what was going in and on the open web is vanishing at an alarming rate without a trace from our colletive intellectual and cultural history. 
</p>

<p>
Take for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>, the inventor of Wiki (both the concept and its first implementation). The <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/">WikiWikiWeb/C2 Wiki</a> was frozen in 2015. Its content is in read-only mode ever since. Since then Ward is remodelling its software basis, but in <a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/51#issuecomment-832759167">an issue on github</a> he wrote: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I should explain why wiki worked.</p>
<p>
I wrote a program in a weekend and then spent two hours a day for the next five years curating the content it held. For another five years a collection of people did the same work with love for what was there. But that was the end. A third cohort of curators did not appear. Content suffered. I had visualizations. I could see it decay. That is what I mean when I say that the those of good will have passed. A security engineer has compared the open internet to the summer of love. It was neat while it was happening but it is over.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I find this stance disheartening, albeit understandable. And the c2 wiki is at least still readable. But for how long will that remain so? 
</p>

<p>
There are many, too many examples of content becoming inaccessible or even destroyed on whim. The highest risk bears everything that is hosted by commercial entities for "free": think for example of Yahoo killing Geocities. This free (as in beer) is penny-wise and pound-foolish. Single copies are single points of failure and hopeing somebody will keep the lights on is not a viable backup stragegy.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of backups: One of the very few organization that tackles the problem of preserving the web is the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. Sadly, it recently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/26/1166101459/internet-archive-lawsuit-books-library-publishers">lost a lawsuit against big publishers</a>, which has the potential to completely destroy it financially. And it appears that there is no meta-backup strategy in place.
</p>

<p>
What can an invidual do? Those who create websites might want to consider to follow Jeff Huangs approach and <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">design their websites to last</a>. Probably another good idea would be to explicitely use a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks/">for free cultural works</a> to allow content to be mirrored without legal headaches.
</p>

<p>
As much as I'd like to end on a high note, it is obvious that such issues cannot be tackled by an invidiual or small idealistic non-profit groups and the economic incentives are not in the favor of an open web.
