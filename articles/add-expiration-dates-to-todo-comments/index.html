    <p>
        When I spot an idea for a non-trivial refactoring, I often add a TODO comment.
        The ideas which are not acted upon immediately are often, but not always, valuable.
        A problem is, that they tend to pile up without being resolved.
        In a mid-sized real-world code base that I maintain the ratio was roughly one such comment per 100 SLOC.
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore I decided to add a reasonable explicit expiration date to any such TODO (some 4 to 8
        weeks in the future). When I encounter a comment that has expired, deleting it is a perfectly
        viable cleanup. The code structure obviously was not so bad after all, or else I would
        have put energy into the refactoring already.
