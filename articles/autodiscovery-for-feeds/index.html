Making feeds automatically discoverable
</a>
</h1>

<p>
I am a big fan of reading websites via a feed reader. 
Not all websites offer one, and not all that do link it prominently. 
A good thing therefore is, that a <a href="
https://blog.whatwg.org/feed-autodiscovery">standardized way to make feeds discoverable</a> for feed readers exists. 
So, when I find a website that I'd like to subscribe to, I can simply try to copy the url into the reader of my choice and chances are the reader is able to automatically dig out the URL of the feed.
</p>

<p>
All that is needed to make it work is a single link tag added to the head. 
It has three mandatory attributes: <em>href</em> of course for the URL of the feed, <em>rel</em> with value "alternate" and <em>type</em> with a value of either "application/rss+xml", or application/atom+xml, depending on the feed format. The <em>title</em> attribute is optional, but it's useful if a site offers multiple feeds. 
</p>

<p>
In quite a lot of cases it works like a charm. It used to work here as well. Now, guess which self-proclaimed fan of feeds thought it would be a good idea to rewrite the template of his personal website and managed to forget putting in the following line into the head:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&lt;link href="https://holzer.online/feed.xml" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"&gt;
</code>
