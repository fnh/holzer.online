    </h1>
    <p>
        I first experienced the web in the mid-nineties. At that time CSS wasn't really around and even if the
        first browsers supported it, many pages were just text-heavy unstyled documents. Today you would
        consider such an approach as luddite, yet since the H in HTML stands for hyper<i>text</i> you could
        argue that keeping styling concerns out of markup is the purest form of authoring a document for the
        web.

    <p>
        Today's default choices are quite distinguishably different from that. A minified version of Bootstrap 4
        ships 117kB. As a comparison: I would have to write about 60 to 80 additional articles on this site to
        match that weight with an equal portion of content. And while at it, I'd have to clutter my markup with
        classes over classes. There are of course slimmer css frameworks than Bootstrap, but nonetheless, my
        main motivation is in the writing down useful things, therefore I decided to approach the styling of
        this site quite radically with classless CSS. All styling decisions are taken by CSS which is targeted
        by element selectors only. If I'd bother to minify it, that would clock in little over half a kilobyte,
        and even unminified it is less than 1% of bootstrap.
    </p>

        But page weight isn't the most important thing. A classless CSS approach enables me to author content
        without intermediate representations (e.g. the Markdown flavour du jour in combination with a static
        site generator) directly in HTML while still allowing me to focus on the content.
