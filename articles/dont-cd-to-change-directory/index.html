    <p>
        We all have only a finite number of <a href="https://www.keysleft.com/">keystrokes left</a> and should
        <a href="/articles/is-it-worth-my-time/">use them wisely</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don't know how many years I typed "cd" in the terminal to change my directory, until I learned that
        the shell can interpret anything you type, which is no command, to execute implicitly as argument to cd.
        I enable this by setting an option, with adding the following line to my .bashrc:
    </p>
    <code>
shopt -s autocd
</code>
    <p>
        I hope it might save a few keystrokes for whoever reads this.
