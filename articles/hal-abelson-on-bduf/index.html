Hal Abelson on Big Design Up Front
</a>
</h1>

<p>
In one lecture of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> course, a student asked <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/hal/hal.html">Hal Abelson</a> how the technique of deferred decision making through abstraction he taught relates to <q>the axiom of 'do all your design before any of your code'</q>.
</p>

<p>
Given that Big Design Up Front and the Waterfall process were prevalent notions in introductory courses on software development for a long time - to some extent, they were still present in lectures I took during my studies, over two decades after this recording - that was a great question. I just love the answer that Hal Abelson gave:
</p>

<blockquote>
I bet that's the axiom of someone who hasn't implemented very large computer systems. [...]
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DrFkf-T-6Co?start=2291&end=2299">In general, I think people who really believe that you design everything before you implement it, basically are people who haven't designed very many things.</a></em>
</blockquote>

<p>
But what may be a fallacy to most of those who actually write software - Uwe Friedrichsen elaborated on it very clearly in his article <a href="https://www.ufried.com/blog/industrialization_fallacy/">The Industrialization of IT fallacy</a> - is still something that I see actively pursued and pushed by a certain type of executives. Of course, it's the 21st century and its a SaFE bet that we are all more or LeSS agile. But if you are looking for today's waterfall - apart from terrible puns on waterfall-like processes in the previous sentence - you often just have to take a look at the org-chart. Those who paid attention to <a href="https://www.melconway.com/research/committees.html">Mel Conway's observations on system design from 1968</a> know, that organizational design influences the shape of the software that gets build.
