If you ask yourself, why you should write online, for you fear you won't be read, Manuel Monreale has an answer. He offers to be <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it/">your first reader</a>. Chris Hannah also decided that he'd like to <a href="https://chrishannah.me/ill-read-it/">read your blog</a>. I share Chris' opinion, that <q>the internet would be a more interesting place if more people blogged</q>.

If you start a new blog, or already have one and your only visitors are bots: <a href="javascript:decryptEmail('ZmFiaWFuQGhvbHplci5vbmxpbmU/c3ViamVjdD1SZWFkIG15IGJsb2c=');">send it to me</a>, I'd love to read it. If you provide <a href="/articles/content-fast-and-slow">a feed</a> for it, even better, I'll add you to my feedreader. And when I finally find some time to create a blogroll, you'll be in there as well.
