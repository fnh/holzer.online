<p>
    I consciously setup my website as minimal as possible. It's liberating to have a the content immediately
    in a representation that renders <a href="/articles/benefits-of-classless-css/">good enough</a>. Yet

    rather soon. A small tool chain could also work, but I would lose the feeling of immediacy.
