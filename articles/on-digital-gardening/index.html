        On content-focused websites the prevalent pattern for the organizing content is the blog format: a list
        of articles/posts presented in reverse-chronologically order. Amy Hoy wrote <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/">a criticism of this organizational
            pattern</a>, which found some resonance. So nowadays - as everything old is new again - a bunch of
        personal websites started to conscientiously style and organize themselves as <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">digital gardens</a>.

        Now, there is no copyright to that term, but one overarching concept I see and very much like is, that
        articles are not seen as something that is written once and then finished after the publication, but as
        a seed which might grow into something that eventually becomes evergreen, more akin to a well-organized
        public (read-only) wiki.

        I haven't yet figured out how I will this page in the long run, currently it is much more a blog than a
        garden, yet I find the idea to go back to existing article and enhance them over time very intriguing.
