<h1>Can you ever know enough about people?</h1>

<p>
    I recently finished <i><a href="/references/100-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-people/">100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People</a></i>.
</p>

<p>
    Susan Weinschenk has compiled a lot of research into a hundred short essays.
    The book covers a lot of ground with topics ranging from perception, over
    how human memory and thinking and decision making processes work to how
    humans tend to deal with errors.
</p>

<p>
    The book doesn't require any prior knowledge. It is very digestible and actionable.
    The chapters are to the point and contain a condensed list of key takeaways.
    No reading order is required. Being very broad in topics makes it rather hard to summarize -
    yet cheapskates and people in a hurry could probably even get some insights
    out of simply reading once through the table of contents.
</p>

<p>All in all: a recommended reading.</p>
