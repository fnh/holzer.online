<h1>Small things matter for accessibility</h1>
<p>
Can you spot the difference between <b>bold</b>, <strong>strong</strong> and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">span with an font-weight bold</span>? How about the difference between <i>italic</i>, <em>emphasized</em> and a <span style="font-style: italic;">span with font-style italic</span>? If you do, you most likely either have opened your browsers' developer tools or you are using a screen-reader.

A colleague of mine recently reviewed a part of a UI component library I worked on with regard to accessibility. He found a line where I used a &lt;b&gt; tag instead of a &lt;strong&gt; tag and rightfully remarked that I'd better use sematic tags.

<p>
After the review, I thought about the reason I came up with the non-semantic markup in the first place. The component was developed against a designers' mockup, and when I derived the markup I translated the visual design in my head to the idea, that this part should be formatted bold, from that my mnemonic association I went straight to the &lt;b&gt; tag.

Satisfying a specification from a mere typographical point of view is not enough. What makes no difference for visually unimpaired people very much matters for users of assistive technologies.
