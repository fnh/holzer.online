<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>
If you'd like to contact me, the best way is to send me a mail. My adress consists of my first name (in lower case letters) followed by this funny symbol which looks like an extravagant version of the first letter of the latin alphabet and ends with any domain I own (including this one). You're all smart people, you've got it figured out already.
