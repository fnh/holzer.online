<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>
If you'd like to contact me, the best way is to <a href="mailto:fabian@holzer.online">send me a mail</a>. If that's more your thing, you can also <a href="https://indieweb.social/@fnh">toot at me on Mastodon</a>. And if you are all business, you may also connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabian-holzer-7858b313a/">LinkedIn</a> (in case we've never crossed paths before, regardless whether online or offline, the odds I'll accept a request will be very high if you mention this site).

<h2>Open Invite</h2>
<p>
In a tradition started by people that are <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/">busier</a> and <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/open-invite/">smarter</a> than I am, this a standing invitation: if you want to talk about something where you think I can help you with: send me a mail. No pretext or excuses necessary. It is usually always a delight when something other than a notification on a failed build finds its way to my inbox.
