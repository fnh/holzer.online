<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
Welcome to my little corner of the web.  
</p>
<p>
My name is Fabian Holzer. I am a software engineer by trade, and programming was a hobby of mine for many years before it became my profession. Apart from that, I've always loved to read widely and avidly and pursue ideas that tickle my curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Writing is essential to my thinking process. I've kept notes on paper and in a private wiki for a long time. I decided to put a  <a href="/articles/">selection of my thoughts</a> on this site. The <a href="/articles/topic/">topics</a> I write about include <a href="/articles/topic/software-engineering/">software engineering</a>, <a href="/articles/topic/web-development/">web development</a>, <a href="/articles/topic/blogging/">blogging and the web in general</a>, but are <a href="/articles/topic/misc/">not limited to that</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in what I'm currently up to, I also have <a href="/now/">Now Page</a>. And consider yourself invited to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>, if you want to discuss anything I wrote about.
