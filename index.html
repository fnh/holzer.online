<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
Welcome to my little corner of the web.  
</p>
<p>
My name is Fabian Holzer. I am a software engineer by trade, and programming was a hobby of mine for many years before it became my profession. Apart from that, I've always loved to read widely and avidly and pursue any <a href="/articles/topic/">topic</a> that tickles my curiosity.
</p>
<p>
Writing is essential to my thinking process. I decided to put a small <a href="/articles/">selection of my notes and thoughts</a> out. If you are interested in things I'm currently up to, there is my <a href="/now">Now Page</a>. And consider yourself invited to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>, if you want to discuss anything I wrote about.
