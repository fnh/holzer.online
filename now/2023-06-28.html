Now
</h1>

Currently, I am

<ul>

<li>
living with my family in Trier, Germany
</li>

<li>
on paternal leave to accompany my daughters' start into kindergarden
</li>

<li>
trying to learn the basics of full-text search / information retrieval by tinkering with <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">lunr.js</a>
</li>

<li>
foolishly attempting to unify the several scripts that I made ad-hoc to create parts of this site into a program that resembles a proper static site generator
</li>

<li>
Reading too many books in parallel:
<ul>
<li>Douglas Hofstader - I Am a Strange Loop
<li>Robin Dunbar - How Religion Evolved: And Why It Endures
<li>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi - Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience
<li>Christopher Booker - Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories 
</ul>

</ul>
