<h1>Now</h1>

Currently, I am

<ul>

<li>
in parental part time to accompany my daughters' start into kindergarden
</li>

<li>
making slow progress on unifing the several scripts that I made ad-hoc to create parts of this site into a program that resembles a proper static site generator
</li>

<li>
Still reading too many books in parallel (in order of progress):
<ul>
    <li>Robin Dunbar - How Religion Evolved: And Why It Endures
    <li>Douglas Hofstader - I Am a Strange Loop
    <li>Christopher Booker - Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories 
    <li>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi - Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience
</ul>

</ul>
