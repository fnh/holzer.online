Currently, I am

<ul>

<li>
working full-time again after four month of parental leave
</li>

<li>
occasionally hacking on <a href="https://github.com/fnh/intertwingle/">intertwingle</a>, the static site generator I wrote to build this website 
</li>

<li>
Looking forward to the first post-pandemic developer event that I will participate in again: this years' <a href="https://unkonf.de">unKonf</a> :)
</li>

</ul>
