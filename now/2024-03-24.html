Currently, I am

<ul>

<li>
working as a software architect in the domain of hospital information systems
</li>

<li>
occasionally hacking on a little bookmark management app for myself and on <a href="https://github.com/fnh/intertwingle/">intertwingle</a>, the static site generator I wrote to build this website
</li>

<li>
apparently mostly done with moving (still don't have a proper kitchen, and we haven't assembeld the sliding doors of one new wardrobe yet) - We've even planted strawberrys, salad and herbs in the little patch of garden we call our own...
</li>

<li>
looking forward to an upcoming few days of vacation around the easter holidays 
</li>

</ul>
