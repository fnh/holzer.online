<h1>Now</h1>

Currently, I am

<ul>

<li>
enjoying a few days of vacation 
</li>

<li>
already over 3000 words into an article on web directories (Working title: Ontologies are underrated)
</li>

<li>
employed as a software architect in the domain of hospital information systems
</li>

<li>
occasionally hacking on a little bookmark management app for myself and on <a href="https://github.com/fnh/intertwingle/">intertwingle</a>, the static site generator I wrote to build this website
</li>

<li>
apparently mostly done with moving (we now nearly have a proper kitchen, the sliding doors of one new wardrobe are still missing) - We've even planted strawberrys, salad and herbs in the little patch of garden we call our own...
</li>


</ul>
