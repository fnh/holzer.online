Currently, I am

Reading: <a href="https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>. Next up in the reading queue: <a href="https://apachekafkabook.com/">Effective Kafka</a>
</li>

<li>
occasionally hacking on a little bookmark management app for myself and on <a href="https://github.com/fnh/intertwingle/">intertwingle</a>, the static site generator I wrote to build this website
</li>

It has been five years since I've seen a live concert, so I'm very exited to watch the show of Jan Delay on the 22nd of June in Trier :)
