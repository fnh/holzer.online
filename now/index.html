Currently, I am

<ul>

<li>
working as a software architect in the domain of hospital information systems
</li>

<li>
Reading: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture
</li>

<li>
over 3000 words into an article on web directories (Working title: Ontologies are underrated) - and having a bit of a hard time coming to a conclusion...
</li>

<li>
occasionally hacking on a little bookmark management app for myself and on <a href="https://github.com/fnh/intertwingle/">intertwingle</a>, the static site generator I wrote to build this website
</li>

<li>
apparently mostly done with moving (yeah, the sliding doors of the wardrobe are still to be assembled. Those packages are mocking me, I can tell you that)...
</li>

</ul>
