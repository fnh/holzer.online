<h1>Now</h1>

Currently, I am

<ul>

<li>
working as a software architect in the domain of hospital information systems
</li>

<li>
Reading: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture
</li>

<li>
after what I wrote in <a href="/articles/2024/05/05/ontology-is-overrated-revisited/">Ontology is overrated, revisited</a>, I am writing a lot of little scripts that scrape and convert some smaller web directories into a common format. I am also thinking about a way to work all of this out in public.
</li>

<li>
occasionally hacking on a little bookmark management app for myself and on <a href="https://github.com/fnh/intertwingle/">intertwingle</a>, the static site generator I wrote to build this website
</li>

<li>
looking forward to a prolonged weekend (over the upcoming bank holiday)
</li>

</ul>
