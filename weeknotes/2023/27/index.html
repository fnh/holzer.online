<h1>Rebooting</h1>

<p>
A little bit over a year ago, I published the last weeknote. It was after a very rough week, which included a bursted pipe in the appartment and a biliary colic. After that week I had lost my momentum an published neither weeknotes, nor regular articles for the following six month.
</p>

<p>
So this is the reboot of the weeknotes. Maybe this time the streak will last more than six weeks. Chances aren't bad. My little daughter has adapted well to kindergarten, still for the next three month I'll work part-time only, so I may have a little more time to spare than otherwise.

Recently I dove into the topic of full-text search and information retrieval. I've toyed around with lunr. For a small codebase (around 1800 SLOC) lunr has a good deal of great ideas in it. I've written about how I gauged the code on a high-level, but if time permits, I'd also like to do some deeper dives into the datastructures and algorithms that are used.
</p>

<p>
Also I'm currently making a static site generator custom to my needs as a replacement for the messy scripts that I currently use to build this site. The sad state of that rewrite is, well, a text-book example of the <a href="/articles/second-system-effect-excerpts/">Second System Effect</a>. So, with that, I'll use the rest of my free time today to try to get it to feature parity with my messy (but working...) scripts.
