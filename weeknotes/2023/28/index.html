<h1>To-do or to-don't?</h1>

<p>
Weeks pass frighteningly fast. All the worse, when you don't feel that there's much to show for it. I had a bit time to hack on my static site generator, still I don't have reached feature parity with my messy scripts. Some time ago I wrote something about keeping a <a href="/articles/write-down-your-makers-bucket-list/">prioritized list of ideas</a> you want to work on. This week I stumbled over Greg Wilsons <a href="https://third-bit.com/ideas/">"To-Don't" list of ideas</a> he found generally interesting, but ultimately decided that he won't pursue. I've got the feeling this kind of anti-list is of equal, if not even more importance than a "to make"-bucketlist (anyway, mine is rather short currently: the ssg for my site, and a little UI overhaul of the <a href="/articles/2023-05-28-side-project-lessons/">minimalist bookmark manager</a> I wrote for myself).
