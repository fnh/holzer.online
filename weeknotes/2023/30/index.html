There is this saying, that when you aren't embarrased by the first version of a software, you have shipped too late. I am not entirely convinced of its merit, but anyway, I put the repo of the <a href="https://github.com/fnh/intertwingle/">static site generator</a> I talked about before on github. Does the world really need another static site generator? Well, maybe the world doesn't, but I like to have a tool that is <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/">built around my workflows</a>.
