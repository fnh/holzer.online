<h1>Digital clean-up</h1>

<p>
In Gregor Hohpe's book <i>The Software Architect Elevator</i> there is a chapter with the beautiful headline: If you never kill anything, you will live among zombies - And they will eat your brain. As I hinted <a href="/weeknotes/2023/35/">last week</a>, dead and undead code isn't very satisfying to work with, so in the spirit of Ken Thompsons bonmot <q>One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code</q>, my efforts culminated this week in a merge requests which implements a feature in negative 780 SLOC.

And as I was in digital clean-up mood, I also pruned my wiki. Consolidating notes and throwing away drafts that didn't lead anywhere left it both over a hundred entries smaller and more useful to me than before. Sometimes less is more.
