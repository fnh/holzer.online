<h1>
A short bleep...
</h1>
<time datetime="2023-11-12 22:00"></time>

<p>
As my family and I are looking forward to move into a new home in January, the next weeks will be filled by throwing out junk that accumulated over the years, packing up our belongings into boxes, looking for new furniture etc.pp. and I'll likely be hard-pressed for time to write &mdash; therefore, as a short bleep before I go radio silent, I want to cluster some ideas that I'd like to pick up, once I have a little more time at my disposal again. 
</p>

<ul>

<li>
I'd like to finish a draft about the implementation of the little web component that <a href="/weeknotes/2023/43/">I mentioned previously</a>. This one has the strongest chance to still get done this year.
</li>

<li>
There's a pile of scattered notes on microfrontend architectures, that have accumulated over the nearly eight years that I'm working on that topic professionally. I'd like to consolidate them with my personal experience and opinions on it. As that might get out of hand and maybe deserves a longer treatment, I'm thinking about experimenting with some kind of preplanned article series.
</li>

<li>
Earlier this year I mused about the <a href="/articles/2023/06/27/se-great-books-curriculum/">great books of software engineering</a>, but the article was a bit unconclusive. I will have to pack up my library soon and thought, when I unpack the books, I'd like to do some reviews and summaries on a selected few items.
</li>

<li>
Then, and this one is a bit of a moonshot topic, earlier this year, I took some interest in the current state of rapid application development. I'm still occasionally asking myself why, a quater of a century after the final release of Visual Basic 6, nothing has emerged that lives up to its developer experience, when it comes to making UIs and wrapping them up with a datasource. I have a some hypotheses about that, though...
</li>

<li>
The quality of the major search engines have deteriorated over the last years to the point where their results are basically garbage. The rise of LLMs has, if anything, accelerated their enshittification. Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose... I'd like to dive into the topic of curated web directories and explore whether there are lessons to be learned from the demise of Yahoo and DMOZ and if smaller directories could somehow become (again) a backbone for finding information on the web.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
If any of you'd like to talk about such stuff, feel free to shoot me a <a href="/contact.html">mail</a>. Until next time, take good care :).
