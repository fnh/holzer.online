So, half a year has past since I wrote <a href="/weeknotes/2023/45/">the last weeknote</a>. This is arguably an indicator that the a fixed schedule does not quite work out for me. On the other hand, the <a href="/weeknotes/2023/27/">first reboot</a> of week-noting was after stopping for a complete year. So, MTTR (mean time to recovery) is clearly improving.

Some time ago I wrote about a <a href="/articles/2023-05-28-side-project-lessons/">little bookmarking app</a>, that I made for myself. Well, I tweaked it a bit since, and now it can group my link collection by various criteria, one of them being the weeks that I added the bookmark. And so I thought, let's revisit what is in there and share a few articles that stood the test of time. So here's half a dozend, that stem from week 19 of 2022 (that is when I found them, which is not necessarily the same week or even year that they were written), that I think you might enjoy.

Justin Etheredge discusses the trade-offs between RDBMSes and NoSQL, with a focus on the merits of the former. If you are in a position to give advice to software engineers early in their career, consider telling them that <a href="https://www.simplethread.com/relational-databases-arent-dinosaurs-theyre-sharks/">Relational Databases aren't dinosaurs, they're sharks</a>.

Maybe it is no conincidence that I also bookmarked Kellan Elliott-McCrea list of <a href="https://kellanem.com/notes/new-tech">Questions for a new technology</a> in the same week.

<a href="https://allendowney.com">Allen Downey</a> has published over a dozend textbooks books on computer and data science topics. He generously makes them available for free under <a href="https://greenteapress.com/">Green Tea Press</a>, print versions of many of his books are also published via O'Reilly and No Starch.

Andrew Healeys post about on <a href="https://healeycodes.com/tiny-project-to-completion">A Tiny Project, From Inception to Deployment</a> is in my eyes examplary with regard to many aspects: the chosen scope, balance of explanation, visualization and showing working code and the overall length. Frankly that is the kind of writing on software I aspire to do more often, as I am often struggling with that very balance. Either I become lost in line-of-code-level minutiae or am rambling in the vague, most often ending with an article being canned, or lingering forever in the limbo that is my drafts folder...

John Hoare has a word of advice for those of us who maintain personal websites: <a href="https://www.dirtyfeed.org/2022/05/design-for-creation/">Design for Creation</a>. The gist, for those in a hurry: <q cite="https://www.dirtyfeed.org/2022/05/design-for-creation/">a good design helps you write and publish. And a bad design is one which gets in the way, and makes sharing your ideas difficult</q>.

I've intentionally put that advice prior to sending you down the rabbit holes that Wouter Groeneveld has collected in <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/04/cool-things-people-do-with-their-blogs/">Cool Things People Do With Their Blogs</a>. Consider yourself warned ;)

And a last one, that is also from the links of week 19/2022, but as I don't hot-link image resources on general principle, I've put is as a copy on my site. I use memes rather sparingly, but this one is pure gold that I've sent to quite a few of my coworkers at appropriate points in time:
