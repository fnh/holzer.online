<h1>A few old ideas</h1>
<time datetime="2024-05-21 19:10"></time>

As I reviewed my bookmarks from the weeks 20 and 21 of 2022, I noticed that a recurring motive were neat old ideas. 
</p>

<p>
First I found an article by Mark Nelson about <a href="
https://www.kmjn.org/notes/operator_precedence_fortran.html
">Operator precedence by textual substitution</a>, which describes a suprisingly simple method to handle the evaluation of arithmetic expressions, that stems from the early 1960s. I once had an job interview, where I was asked about this very problem. I went down with the "convert infix to reverse-polish-notation and traverse the tree" path. I wish I had known this neat little trick then...

Tom Stuart shows in <a href="https://tomstu.art/programming-with-nothing">Programming with Nothing</a> how you can take nearly everything away from a programming environment and still accomplish computations. In restrospect, this is what I would have needed in the theoretical computer science course that was my introduction to the lamdba calculus.

And as a contrast, on the other end of the spectrum, George Lungu, on his blog <a href="https://excelunusual.com/">Excel Unusual</a> shares cool ways of solving engineering and science problems and modeling and visualizing natural phenomena. Hundreds of spreadsheats with some very deep ideas available. Also a good reminder to never underestimate spreadsheats.

Lastly, if you are into well-hung (or battle-tested) ideas, you might enjoy the archives of <a href="https://hn.lindylearn.io/">Lindy Hacker News</a>, which collects classic articles that get frequently reposted on Hacker News.
