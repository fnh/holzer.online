The Pew research center recently published an estimation that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">38% of webpages from 2013 are no longer accessible</a>. And, as if to underline the point, a few days ago the <a href="https://mastodon.archive.org/@internetarchive/112513905401989149
">Internet Archive was hit by a  DDoS attack</a>. <a href="/articles/2023/06/15/preserving-the-web/">Preserving the web continues to be an open problem</a>, and this is a reminder to archive things you care about locally, where it is possible. Given that state of affairs, here's a few articles I found interesting, which against the odds are still online. They share a common thread: all of them are about exemplary software design ideas.

Asher Olsen lays out the internals of the <a href="https://texdraft.github.io/lisp-compiler/internals.html">First Lisp Compiler</a>. What I find fascinating is how many high-level features could be realized by ingeniously mapping some syntactical sugar over lambda calculus to the instruction set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">a computer from the mid-1950s</a>. However, I've to admit that the details still go over my head, but what else is to be expected by the language from which the gods wrought the universe (at least <a href="https://xkcd.com/224/">ostensibly so</a>, as xkcd reminds us)?

So let's come back to <a href="https://raganwald.com/2013/07/19/javascript-is-a-lisp.html">a lisp</a> more suitable for mere mortals: Javascript. A few month before Musk decided to cure my addiction to the bird site (and contributing a bit to the 38% of URLs that have vanished), <a href="https://frankforce.com">Frank Force</a> tweeted a program, fitting in 256 bytes of JS and HTML, which renders a city landscape using ray casting. Daniel Darabos shortly afterwards reverse-engineered and dissected its inner workings in <a href="https://observablehq.com/@darabos/decoding-a-city-in-a-bottle">Decoding A City In A Bottle</a>. Frank recently also wrote a <a href="https://frankforce.com/city-in-a-bottle-a-256-byte-raycasting-system/">break down of his code</a>.

Last, but not least: Greg Wilson has made his book <a href="https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/">Software Design by Example - a tool-based introduction with JavaScript</a> freely available only. I've still got to work through some of the chapters, but it is the kind of book that would be on my shortlist for a <a href="/articles/2023/06/27/se-great-books-curriculum/">Great books of software engineering curriculum</a>. If you're into making software, you might also want to checkout the rest of Gregs impressive <a href="https://third-bit.com/bib/">bibliography</a>.
