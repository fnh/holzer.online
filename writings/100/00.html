<p>
Welcome friend, this is the first entry in a new category, that will not be advertised by making it a part of he main navigation, nor be broadcast. As much as I love feeds: these entries are meant to be browsed. The idea is to limit the number of entries to 100, which is inspired by the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> challenge. I am not pursuing the goal of making it to that number within 365 days, and if my pace of publishing in the past is any indicator, it might take me about half a decade (give or take a year) to get there.
</p>

<p>
Some time ago I introduced the weeknotes as way to find a fixed schedule. My weeknoting has once again stalled. I won't go in the details as to why,  suffice to say, currently the daily routines are all little bit more strenuous than hoped for.
</p>

<p>
To counter my publishing paralysis, in here there are no self-imposed rules: no fixed schedule, no meaningful titles, maybe sometimes no title at all, but also: no visibility. Writings in here are not intended to pop up in anybodys feed reader. There won't be an index page. Within the category itself, every article is part of a chronological chain via a linear navigation on the top. How would these pages be found then? Well, maybe by sending the URL to somebody via mail (unlikely, but not unthinkable), or via links on the rest of the site (also not that likely), or probably via the backlinks (that would, if I were to reference another article/weeknote, be  automatically appended there). So, this is bound to become what Mark Irons called a <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/secret.garden.html">secret garden</a> on the site, something that a visitor can discover by through exploration.
</p>

<p>
Let's see how far this will go.
