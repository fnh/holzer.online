I do not have a "Plan B".
</p>

<p>
Recently a good friend visited us. And over coffee and cake the question came up, what we thought we'd do to win our bread, if for some reason we'd want or need to leave our current occupation or even profession behind.

Sure, from time to time I do have flippant escapist daydreams. But neither  alpaca farming, nor running an antiquarian bookshop is an appropriate plan for somebody with dependents.

I am not on the run, though. Writing software is still quite a decent way to make a living. If it weren't for all those pesky non-programmers it would surely be somewhere in the top 20 of dream jobs.
