Am I a hypocrite for not exposing this category via a feed? Probably. I once wrote that <a href="/articles/content-fast-and-slow/">offering a feed empowers the reader</a>. Which it is and I still think that as a default it is the right thing to do.

But putting something out on the web is also, maybe even primarily so, an act of self-empowerment. I created this little site of mine to have fun. The "Performing" in public aspect is often part of the fun, but other times the very idea that a half-baked rambling of mine makes somebodys feedreader go <i>ping</i>, gives me paralyzing stage-fright. Therefore, within this section of my site, the feed had to give way.

Yaidel recently said that <a href="https://poview.org/posts/i-dont-like-rss/">he doesn't like RSS</a>, and prefers to see the content in the context of the whole website. He writes: <q>I prefer to immerse myself in the whole experience, taking in what you have to say with your words, but also what you have to express with your website's design. Personal websites are just that: an immersion experience into someone else's world.</q>

Not everybody who visits me sees every corner of our home. With friends and family we have a policy: you can come by anytime you want, but keep your eyes closed. We've got two fulltime jobs, three kids and better things to do with our time than to keep everything presentable all of the time. Why should that not apply to a home on the web?
