At work I live, to some degree at least, in an asynchronous world. I presume most programmers do, except maybe the few remaining true adherents of XP's philosophy of always programming in pairs.

Anyway, in an async world, it is a huge pain and waste when scheduled synchronous work time is ursurped with activities that would lend themselves very good to be done in an asynchronous manner together. Usually that is a form of one person delegating his personal work to a whole group.

Don't do that. If you happen to be in a position of power (be it through hierarchy, tenure or otherwise) this applies doubly so.
