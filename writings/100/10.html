<h1>Ten</h1>

<p>
Ten. That's how old my boy turned a few days ago. Ten. A decade. Double-digits. I swear, just a few days ago he was only five. 
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">tail end</a> comes nearer. Menacingly. Day by day.
</p>

<p>
Time is a strange thing. A river with a mighty current. Capable of
<a href="https://lars-christian.com/grief-is-a-boulder/">polishing even the heaviest boulders</a>.
</p>

<p>
Which just reminds me of Erich KÃ¤stners <a href="https://www.deutschelyrik.de/das-eisenbahngleichnis.html">Eisenbahngleichis</a> - the parable of the train, where the last verse reads (translation by me, ostentatiously not a poet):
</p>

<p>
We all have boarded the same train,<br>
towards the present which is yet to be.<br>
We watch out the window, with what we saw, we are content.<br>
We all have boarded the same train,<br>
but many in the wrong compartment.
