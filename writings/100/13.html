Just for my reference, a bookmarklet to <a href="javascript:for(i=0;i<document.styleSheets.length;i++){void(document.styleSheets.item(i).disabled=true);}el=document.getElementsByTagName('*');for(i=0;i<el.length;i++){void(el[i].style.cssText='');}">Remove CSS</a> from a website.

I adore the many creative personal choices regarding aesthetics that are enabled by this medium, it's just, sometimes I need a little calmer reading environment.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">Bookmarklets</a> are really one of the great remnants of the web that used to be (that still is if you know where to look, that still might become...), an opportunity for browser to indeed act as the agent of the user in a meaningful sense of the word.
