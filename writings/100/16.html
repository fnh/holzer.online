I just stumbled over this take on <a href="https://www.bobvanvliet.com/chunked/chunks/">Chunked Writing</a>. This piece got me thinking: should the dynamic medium that is be both controllable and controlled like this?
</p>

<p>
I hate when somebody tries to go over my head: if I want to skim, I want to skim. Who are you to decide how I want to read? Are you Goethe? Have you won the Nobel price for literature?
</p>

<p>
At least, that site stops hijacking the scrollbar and the keyboard and behaving like a proper website once its  <a href="/writings/100/13.html">styling is removed</a></a>. But deciding to do this it the first place reeks of the "I know better than the user"-philosophy that plagues software in general and the web in particular. Designer hubris at its worst. And I know the profession and their god complex. Well intentioned - most of them at least - but as the saying about good intention goes: the road to hell is paved with 'em.
