What is a good size of code to put forward to a review? Just important enough to be interesting. And that is small. When you extend mature codebase, you'll come across so many opportunities to tidy up, and they probably should be seized, as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121220300674">tech debt reduces both morale and productivity of developers</a>. By all means, be a good scout, and leave the campground better than you found it. Just, please, put it in a seperate merge request. One thing at a time. Small steps. Try not to overload the cognitive system of the reviewer. Seperate the signal from the noise.
