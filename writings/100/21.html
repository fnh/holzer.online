I like bidirectional links (aka backlinks) because they make connections visibile, especially when I re-encounter older writings. The combination of backlinks and "standard" link also carves a path between related articles, even if they don't reference each other directly. This got me thinking, that to the extent that such indirect internal connections are a proxy for "relatedness of ideas", then two pages which link to the same external resource (to some degree) could also be considered related. I'd like to try the effect out with the <a href="/links/internal/graph/">content graph</a>
