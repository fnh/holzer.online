I've said it before: <a href="/articles/2023/06/15/preserving-the-web/">preserving the web is an unsolved problem</a>. Google is going to <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">kill yet another service</a>: they'll <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/">shut down their URL shortener</a> and thereby causing a severe case of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">uncool urls</a>.

<p>
Probably big tech just wants to teach the world why it should better not depend on them, and in general why it is healthy to be sceptical of thirdpartys and other companies computers (aka cloud) for that matter. On an unrelated note, today's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident">global CrowdStrike incident</a> has already caused enough trouble to earn its own wikipedia entry...
</p>
<p>
So I repeat: Do not relinquish control of critical systems to big tech vendors unreflected and unnecessarily.

At long last they are very consistent in their behavior. They honor their mission statement <q>to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful</q> in the very same way that they honor their motto of <q>don't be evil</q>.
