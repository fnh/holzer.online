I'm continuing the search for <a href="/writings/100/17.html">educational codebases</a> by making use of the Hacker News hivemind, here a few pointers to resources taken from the 2009 thread <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=879101">What source code is worth studying?</a>. I focus mostly on book recommendations, without wanting to dispute the quality of the many suggested codebases,  it's just that being good does not translate directly to being educational as well.
</p>

<p>
Multiple commenters suggested <a href="https://drh.github.io/cii/">C Interfaces and Implementations: Techniques for Creating Reusable Software</a> by David Hanson, as well as <a href="https://drh.github.io/lcc/">LCC- A Retargetable Compiler for ANSI C</a> by the same author.
</p>

<p>
Another suggestion was Diomidis Spinellis books <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/codereading/">Code Reading: The Open Source Perspective</a> and <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/codequality/">Code Quality: The Open Source Perspective</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then there was another mention for <a href="https://warsus.github.io/lions-/">Lions' Commentary on Unix 6th edition</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then somebody suggested the source code of Quake and pointed to an article by <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net">Fabien Sanglard</a>, who has also written several studies of other classic game engines (Doom and Wolfenstein 3D).
</p>

<p>
Peter Norvigs <a href="https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp">Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming</a> was also mentions alongside Paul Grahams book <a href="https://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's interesting to notice how much C seems to dominate this topic, but that might be due to its ubiqiutousness in systems programming and the age of the resources (the codebases are even older than the books written on them).
