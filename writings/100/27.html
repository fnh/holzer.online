Coming back to the personal website patterns, I riffed about <a href="/writings/100/14.html">standard content pages</a> (or as other people call them: slash pages or cornerstones) before in general, and I think that the contact page is a rather uncontroversial candidate. 
</p>

<p>
I said in <a href="/articles/2024/02/29/">Websites as a catalyst for personal relationships</a> that I think the personal web is designed and destined to be a two-way street. But that was more of statement of the social than of technical nature of the medium.
</p>

<p>
By its design the web decouples sender and receiver with regard to location and time. The author of a website shouts into the void of the ether. The reader of a website can remain in obsurity. They may choose to stay but a line in a server log. In any meaningful sense, a bidirectional communication can only be established by the reader of a website.
</p>

<p>
Therefore a <i>Contact page</i> is created to aid and facilitate the establishment of feedback and meaningful conversations. A <i>Contact page</i> communicates at least one medium by which the author of a website intends to receive messages. It must be a reasonable assumption that the chosen medium is accessible to many of their readers. It certainly is not limited to one channels. Email adress, a contact form or a list of handles on preferred social websites are some (non-exhaustive) examples. What ever the preferred channel of the websites author might be, the <i>Contact page</i> makes it explicit and prominently linked. Thereby it provides an affordance to make the public writing a starting point for a private dialog, which in turn might become the seed of a meaningful interpersonal relationship.  
</p>

<p>
One particular special case or enhancement of a generic contact page pattern might take the form of a <i>Standing Invitation</i>. This is a format that was to my knowledge pioneered  by <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/">Patrick McKenzie</a> to explicitly encourage cold emails from potentially shy readers. Quite a few people have followed suit, for example: <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/open-invite/">Hillel Wayne</a>, <a href="https://lars.hupel.info/about/">Lars Hupel</a>, <a href="https://www.trevormckendrick.com/essays/standing-invitation">Trevor McKendrick</a>, <a href="https://kaidavis.com/contact/invitation/">Kai Davis</a>, <a href="https://www.hawkins.io/standing-invitation/">Adam Hawkins</a>, <a href="https://btribble.com/contact/">Bill Tribble</a>, <a href="https://matthewpalmer.net/standing-invitation/">Matthew Palmer</a>, <a href="https://paika.tech/standing-invitation/">Chris Paika</a> and <a href="https://dellacorte.me/about">Andrea Della Corte</a>.
