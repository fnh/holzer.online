Personal websites come in very different formats, organizational styles or maybe even genres.
</p>

<p>
The most popular is certainly the blog: a collection of articles ("posts"), presented in reverse-chronological order. Some personal websites are subdivided into sections that could each be considered by this definition a blog of their own, e.g. linkblogs, short-form writing/notes/thoughts/microblogging and "proper" articles/essays.
</p>

<p>
Not every site is necessarily created primarily as a platform for content distribution. A sizeable number of personal websites serve as an equivalent to a business card: a hub to a persons profiles on other platforms, if you will a single big <a href="/writings/100/27.html">Contact page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another notable genre are portfolio websites, which showcase the work of a person (projects, artwork, design, photography, music, performances, ...). For even if a website is belonging clearly to a single person (as opposed to the website of a group, a corporation or about a specific subject/topic), the reason its existence might indeed be to conduct business, establishing personal credibility by demonstrating prior work can be a part of that. 
</p>

<p>
Next up are various forms which are closely related to each other, but not equivalent: Digital Gardens, Zettelk√§sten, Wikis, Personal Knowledge Bases, commonplace books. These styles are distinct from the typical blogging, as they deemphasize the timeline as organizational pattern of the presentation and navigation. A further disambiguation of these would deserve a treatment of its  own.
</p>

<p>
Most of these genres are not mutually exclusive, nor is the list exhaustive. A personal website might evolve from form one into another or might add parts as it grows over time.
