Chris asks: <q>How much thought do you give to the RSS feed on your blog?</q>. Well, quite a bit I'd think, but probably not as much as Chris does. Two aspects to the answer: The raison d'Ãªtre of my site and the limitiations of the medium.
</p>

<p>
There are many reasons I put something online, but honestly most are selfish. No, I don't want to make any money of this. I don't want to make a name for myself. Nothing of that. But I want to have fun. I said it in the <a href="/articles/2021-01-20-it-has-been-a-while/">inaugural post</a>: This site exists as an attempt at rekindling what was the passion that drew me into my field. And at the time of writing this, a successful attempt. I also reap many other benefits that I had not thought of when I started. Michael Nielsen wrote an article on <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/wn/website_enhance.html">how a website can be used to enhance one's ability to think and create</a>, which resonated very much with me when I read it. Writing is my preferred method of sense-making. Public writing raises the stakes and as a by-product the quality of the thinking. And then, over the course of time, I was lucky to discover that it also facilitates the <a href="/articles/2024/02/29/">joy of connecting on a direct personal level</a> with many kind and interesting folks.
</p>
<p>
Of course I also want what I create to be useful not only for me, but to anybody who cares. And <a href="/articles/content-fast-and-slow/">I love feeds</a> because they empower the readers. Therefore I pretty soon started to offer one. See, this site started completely hand-rolled and the the feed generation was the first part I automated. First very clunkily, with help of a third-party service, then I scripted the feed generation, and out of that script grew my custom SSG <a href="/projects/">intertwingle</a>. So, offering a feed is to me not only a right neighbourly thing to do on the open web, but a principle.
</p>

<p>
Then, you may ask: why is this not popping up in it, you hypocrite? Well, Internet stage-fright. Sounds ridiculous, but it's what it is for me at the moment. So I simply lower the stakes for me again, just a bit, without going back to the private-tiddlywiki-for-my-eyes-only mode. And as this little <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/secret.garden.html">secret garden</a> grows, I start to see that it might soon yield some fruits that could deserve make it to other people's feed readers, because just as Chris wrote: <q>I want to earn the right to stay there</q>.
</p>

<p>
One last aspect: feeds come with limitiations in a few cases - it does not apply for the majority of documents, but to an in my eyes very important category: interactive content that is unique to the web as a medium. The current specs/formats (RSS, Atom, JsonFeed) are just not defined for such content. For example, I wrote two tiny literate javascript programs that describe themself on the very page where they are also executed. I could also add many other examples from other people's work, where it is just not technically possible to give subscribers on the feed the equivalent experience as in the browser.
</p>

<p>
The web as a medium is not just a better old thing, and should not restrict itself to emulate paper. I certainly hope that feeds will technologically evolve over their current capabilities (which were specified in the early oughts) at some point in time.
