Back to the topic of codebases that as objects of study: last time I listed a few examples <a href="/writings/100/22.html">that already are heavily annotated</a>. One approach to grow the number of such <a href="/writings/100/17.html">educational codebases</a> could be to search for  feature-complete and stable programs, which are still small enough to be understood by a single person, and create annotation after the fact as derivative artifact. So here a few candidates for that category:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.nayuki.io/category/programming">Project Nayuki</a> publishes implementations of many algorithms and datastructures in a variety of languages: the <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library">QR Code Generator library</a> is already so well commented that it could in my eyes already be considered educational. The <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/bmp-io-library-java">bitmap I/O</a> library, albeit being factored very well, might for an external reader benefit from a bit of guidance and further comment.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://c9x.me/">Quentin Carbonneaux</a> published a variety of C programs, like a compiler backend, an archiving tool, a text editor or a minimal IRC client, that would be interesting to break down.
</p>

<p>
Last one: I like Alan Dewars implementation of <a href="http://www.cuug.ab.ca/dewara/life/">Conway's Game of Life</a>, as a good example for creating something beautiful with stable web technologies. No time wasted on elaborate build steps, third parties: just plain JS (pre-ES6 style), HTML and SVG. The power of the <a href="https://viewsource.info/">view source web</a>.
