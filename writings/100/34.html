An excerpt out of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970104044631/http://www.research.apple.com/research/proj/learning_concepts/evolution_active_essay/active_essay.html">Active Essays - What is "Serious Discourse" and "Literacy"?</a> by Alan Kay (1996)
</p>

<blockquote>
<mark>Literacy is</mark> more than being able to read a streetsign or write a party invitation -- it is <mark>being fluent in the ideas and issues of humankind and being able to use and create symbolic representations to understand and explore them further</mark>. The pressing issues of the 21st century will require new carriers of serious discourse that will be as large a step from the essay and classical mathematics as those were from collections of proverbs.
</p>
<p>
[..] many of the most serious issues of the next century will involve complex nonlinear systems [..]. These are not easily explained, argued about, or understood in terms of day-to-day language or classical mathematics. But many of their most important characteristics can be dynamically modeled and explored on the computer. [..]
</p>
<p>
The most important media of the 21st century will provide the framework for the next level of human thought.
</p>

<p>
While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface">computational notebooks</a> have made some good progress since this was written, I am under the impression that they don't really provide the framework for next level of human thought. A pity, for indeed the problems of this century are indeed pressing and we could collectively use any real help we can get.
