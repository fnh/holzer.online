Some time ago I stumbled over <a href="https://johncandeto.com/greatquestions">John Candetos list of great questions</a>. I would love it, if that became some kind of <a href="/writings/100/14.html">cornerstone / slashpage</a> on personal websites. Posts/Notes/Articles often come with the preconceived notion that they ought to answer a question rather than to ask one. And good questions don't come easily, while I am in the camp "there is no such thing as a dumb question" (as I think one should avoid creating an atmosphere that discourage the curiosity of a persion), some questions defitively are better than others.

Let's start my own list, a tad meta, with: What are actually my great questions?
