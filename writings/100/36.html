I planted this little secret garden three month ago to this day. I speculated then that it would take up to half a decade to fill it up with 100 posts (the arbitrary limit of 100 items which I set and intend to keep). Yet, here I am, writing the 37th item in this category (counting zero-indexed of course), which is on average twelve times a month. In comparison that is the amount I wrote in each of the first two years here. If I'd keep that pace up, this category would be "full" about half a year from now.

What do I make of this? First, it seems, I sometimes need to trick myself a bit. This is not very much less public than any piece of writing that makes it to the feed, but still it makes a difference. Next: jumping into a topic in the middle can be quite fine. Also, not everything needs to be finished in one sitting. Lastly, headlines are overrated.

<p>
More concretely, I start to see threads coming together. I want to get least one proper article out of this (on educational codebases). When the experiment is concluded, I think I'd want to introduce a new (then not artificially limited) category for this kind of writing and publishing, maybe then even with a feed exposed (but still not as part of the main feed).
