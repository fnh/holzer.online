I've recently re-read Alan Coopers <i>The inmates are running the asylum</i>, which referenced in one chapter a journalistic (or even ethnographic?) book on the culture of a team in Microsoft in the early to mid 1990es, with the somewhat obscure title <a href="/references/i-sing-the-body-electronic/">I Sing The Body Electronic</a> written by Fred Moody. I could not resist going down that rabbit hole and ordered a used copy of this long out of print title, which arrived today. The first chapter ends with a remarkable sentence already:

<blockquote>
