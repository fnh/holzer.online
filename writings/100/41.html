Not quite a <a href="/writings/100/14.html">pattern</a> yet, but still a notable idea: I've seen a few people seeking out penpals via their personal website, often - albeit not always - even with the intention that the correspondence will at some point be published. I can imagine that there is some appeal in having a concrete person to write to, as opposed to the usual "shouting into the void".
