I reflected on <a href="/writings/100/29.html">genres of personal websites</a> before, but within for example a blog there is yet another layer of genres for the different pieces of content that might be posted. Here a - necessarily incomplete - attempt to enumerate the different genres of posts.
</p>

<p>
Subjective/Personal: Opinions, Rants & venting, ramblings, anecdotes, pictures, showcasing your art...
</p>

<p>
Conversational: Replies, Interviews, Quotes with personal reflections, asking open questions
</p>

<p>
Educational material, either created to document your learning, as reference for yourself, or even intended primarily for other people's sake: tutorials, how-tos, deep-dives, "Today I learned...", demos, answering a question, showing a shapshot from your work, guides, walk-throughs ...
</p>

Other people have thought about this as well, see <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/types-of-blog-posts">Types of blog posts by Apple Annie</a> and the Indieweb wiki: <a href="https://indieweb.org/posts">Posts</a>, and the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Category:PostType">Post Types Category</a>, Mark Irons <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/diverse.content.html">Diverse Content</a>
