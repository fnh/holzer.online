Another excerpt out of Fred Moodys <a href="/references/i-sing-the-body-electronic/">I Sing The Body Electronic</a>. The ending of chapter four recounts a corporate drama, that many people might be able relate to: a breakdown of communication between people, functions (or whole departments) to the detriment the success of both the individual as well as the overall system.
</p>

<blockquote>
As they tried to predict Gammill's reaction to their desires, Bjerke and Ballinger found themselves unable to settle on how much or how little certain of these effects would matter. [...] The problem, of course, was that she [Bjerke] and Ballinger were working almost completely in the dark. Had Gammill been sitting in the room with them, he might have savend them hours of dreaming and analyzing. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Part of the tragedy is that it takes only one party to let the communication break down...

<blockquote>
Mostly, he would remind himself sternly of the reason he was behind schedule and working around the clock on Encarta: he and his fellow developer, Jay Gibson, had promised too much to the encyclopedia's designers. <mark>There might be some mistakes from his past that he was doomed to repeat, Gammill admitted, but promising the impossible to designers would never be one of them.</mark>
</blockquote>

<p>
A textbook example of asymmetric risks: one party is taking most (if not all) of the downside (putting in overtime, long-term maintainance burdens), which creates perverse incentives.
