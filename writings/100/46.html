I don't want to split hairs about terms and definitions here, nor do I wish to devalue anybodys side project, but in my eyes, more than 99.99% of non-corporate websites would best be clearly defined and maintained as hobby. And it is perfectly fine if a hobby provides some value for potential "spectators" (I would love if we'd collectively agreed on readers, but I would even prefer spectator over user), but at the point of publishing the author should already have reapt the benefits of writing: in form of the result, in form of achieved mental clarity, in form of enjoying the process of writing.

Neither emperors nor revolutionaries of yesteryear would have dared to dream of access to a medium like the web. Access to it is somewhere between dirt cheap and free. And somebody's public outlet and voice, their online home should not dependent on pittances. I think a person who intentionally participates in this medium owes that to themself.
