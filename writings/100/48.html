There is a scene in <i>Star Trek: Insurrection</i> that always leaves me a bit yearning for a different pace of life.

<p>
The Ba'ku are a people who have achieved advanced technological capabilities, but choose not to employ them. They live on a planet that perpetually revitalizes them so that they have extraordinarily long healthy livespan. In a dialog between Picard and Anij, a Ba'ku woman, they walk past a beautifully made tapestry which Picard stops to admire and calls "extraordinary craftsmanship". To that Anij replies that it is the just work of students, that are almost ready to be apprentices and whose apprenticeship will take 30 or 40 years until they take their place among the artisans.

Alas, it's just science fiction, but still a reminder: Ars longa, vita brevis. Few things are more vital that having focus and getting your priorities straight.
