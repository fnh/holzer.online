The concetration I have left is not sufficient to properly work on any of the dozens of bullet points that are on my list of writing prompts. Of each point I thought at the time of jotting it down that it would make for a proper topic to elaborate on if I had a bit of time to spare. And now I'm sitting here, barely half an hour of the day left, unable to find coherent words for anything, and wallow in self-pity and write about not being able to properly write. Not a point on that list. Better luck tomorrow, hopefully. Well, maybe, tomorrow starts in 10 minutes, we'll see...

Oh, by the way this category is now officially half-empty or half-full, how ever you want to view it.
