I am not exactly a typography nerd/connaisseur, but I must acknowledge that the choice of font, text-size and related properties can indeed have a huge effect on the perception of a website. This is especially true, when the site is generally text-heavy.
</p>

<p>
Two recent examples, where the choices typography (in conjuction with the content itself!) impressed me were <a href="https://jrsinclair.com/">The enchanted electrical website of Dr. Sinclair</a> and <a href="https://schmud.de/">Beyond the Frame</a>. The latter makes use of <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte.css</a>, which includes the et-book fonts. The former has a wonderful explanation of font choices in its <a href="https://jrsinclair.com/about/#colophon">colophon</a>, to give the gist: Munson for body text, Rosewood Std Fill for headings, Courier Prime for code, and Franklin Gothic FS for sans-serif.
</p>

<p>
And while I admire the results, I don't like the idea of needing to load webfonts, which then dwarf the actual text content by at least one order of magnitude. I chose to rely on system fonts, which nowadays can get you quite far as well. I recently found the <a href="https://modernfontstacks.com/">Modern Font Stacks</a> overview page, which offers some advice and previews for what is possible with a single line of JS without any further need for network requests. I tweaked my previous choices a bit and now use Didone stack, although I removed the "Bodoni MT" option from it.
