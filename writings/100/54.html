It occured to me, that a long time has passed since I last read a work of fiction without losing interest in the plot somewhere in the middle of it. I don't think my attention span in general has suffered to the extent that I am unable follow story lines, but my reading diet is skewed to all most exclusively non-fiction. I am wondering whether that is caused intristically by my interests or a function of age or life circumstances. Not unlikely that all these aspects play into it. At least, I'm certain that I haven't consciously decided to not be interested in works of literature and fiction anymore. But on the other hand, not deciding to and deciding not to, while not exactly being the same, have an equivalent outcome. So, that's that.
