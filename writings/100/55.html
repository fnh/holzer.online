I recently stumbled over <a href="https://singleservingsites.cool/">singleservingsites.cool</a>, a directory of websites that consist only a of single page with a dedicated domain name and which serves only one purpose.
</p>

<p>
The type of sites was immediately recognisable to me, yet I didn't know that there is a dedicated term for it, even though the phenomenon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-serving_site">Single-serving site</a> has an entry on Wikipedia, which dates the coining of the term back to 2008.
</p>

<p>
Those kind of sites have something for them, where I cannot just put the finger on it. Maybe it is because they are finished once they are deployed. You cannot return to very many sites after years or even decades and find them unchanged. Also many of them are whimsical in the best sense of the word: just some good fun. Many of them come without the <a href="https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/">nuisances of the surveillance web</a> and don't try to sell you something (or sell your data to somebody).
</p>

<p>
The more I think about it, the more I want to put one out as well: now I need a good idea, an available domain and a bit of time to hack.
