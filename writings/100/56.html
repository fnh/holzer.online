I've been thinking about adding a webdirectory to the site, and even contemplated buying a dedicated domain for it, but I'm having doubts whether I could sustain it in the way I imagine it.
</p>
<p>
What I'd like to do: curate non-commercial (ideally no SEO, tracking and ads) sites which provide deep dives on interesting topics beyond computing and tech. Basically I image a combination of an extendend linkblog with a short independent review of the whole site (not just a copy of the intro blurb / metatags) and a handful of picks of favorite articles (3 to 7) combined with a directory-style taxonomy (maybe not mutually exclusive, but rather tag based). I'd estimate that would require at least 30 minutes per site to do it halfway decently, and probably that is too optimistic. If I'd aim at a single site published per day over the period of a year, that would be 182,5 hours. If I round that up to 200 for technical setup and other tasks, it would be 5 whole workweeks. Which is quite a huge chunk for the overall time budget for hobby projects. And then I'd have a cute little directory of 365 websites.

All this makes me appreciate projects like <a href="https://ooh.directory">ooh.directory</a> even more.
