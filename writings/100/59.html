The current topic in mathematics are positional notations. My kid didn't realize which base was meant in the workbook and asked whether they really have to enumerate all the 9000 numbers from 1000 to 10000. It was in the binary system of course, but that it did seem quite possible in their eyes that such a mind numbing stupid task could be asked of them tells you all you need to know about the educational system...
