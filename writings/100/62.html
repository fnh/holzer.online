A thought experiment: If I would remove the top-level navigation from the site, would it still be reasonably usable? Could every article, weeknote or other writing still be reached somehow?

Stated as graph theory problem: when pages are the nodes and links are the edge between them, would the set of pages be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)">connected graph</a> if the edges(links) provided by the shared navigation bar were removed? I think answer in my case is no, as there are a few pages that are only linked via one of the index pages of my categories/topics, and those are the ones that every page is connected to via the navigation bar, but not otherwise. But if the pages were more densely interlinked, I could theoretically remove the navigation bar and still be able to get to every page without having to know/enter the URL manually, although I doubt it would provide a better design, as the paths might get very long and tedious to find.
