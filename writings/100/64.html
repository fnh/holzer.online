Yesterday I attended <a href="https://unkonf.de">unKonf</a> in Mannheim, which since my first visit in 2016 is among my favorite events of the year: a web development centered unconference that attracts a community of very friendly, curious and open-minded people. I always leave with a lot of renewed enthusiasm for my vocation (and I'm deliberatly not chosing the word job or even profession here). Quite a few similar events that used to be a fixpoint in my calendar did not survive the pandemic, which is all the more reason to take the advice that <a href="https://feryn.eu/">Thijs Feryn</a> gave during the keynote session and deliberatly break out of the corporate mold every once in a while to be where the action is. I am very happy that <a href="https://www.hochdoerfer.de/">Stefan Hochd√∂rfer</a> announced another edition for 2025. I'll be there.
