Dave Winers blog <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a> turns 30 years today. The Guardian published a piece with the lovely title <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer">The blogosphere is in full bloom. The rest of the internet has wilted</a> about Daves influential work and and the wider state of the blogging ecosystem.

Well, to that I can only say: happy anniversary and here's to decades of blogging to come!
