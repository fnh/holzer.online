I've started to apply a bit more scrutiny to the feeds that I subscribe to. In general the RSS timeline is much calmer than browsing Hacker News, Mastodon or the likes, but still I want to focus my attention more on high-signal channels. So, when I now see an article that is too far from my interest, I skim the last entries of the site and make a judgement call whether or not to keep it. I've removed maybe 5% of my feeds so far. As general rule, I still add a site when I find one good article on it, but if it turned out that the good article was the outlier, well, being anonymously subscribed to a feed is not exactly the same as a marriage proposal, although I still honor my standing invitation to be the first reader of somebodys personal site.
