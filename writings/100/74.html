I've argued <a href="/writings/100/33.html">before</a> that I consider the <i>page</i> to be the most basic building block of a website, in the sense that the more specialized concepts like article, reply, blog post, note all have an is-a relationship to it.
</p>

<p>
That point of view shares a drawback of base abstractions that cover the commonalities a vast set of usecases: it is not very descriptive.

<p>
If so many things are pages, then what isn't? Arguably static assets like images, video, audio, stylesheets or scripts, and more conceptually also things like partials for common header/footer/navigation elements.
