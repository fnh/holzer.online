I think most folks who write in public have self-imposed rules on what they publish. I definitively have. I said in the <a href="/writings/100/00.html">very first entry to this category</a> that in here there are none, in order to counter the paralysis that I've felt at the time. Well, that is probably not entirely true, as I think there are still some constraints that I impose on my public writing without being really aware of them.
</p>
<p>
Still, loosening <i>some</i> of the constraints that I was aware of  gave my willingness to put my thinking out in the open a huge boost. My inner censor is still unhappy with half-finished stuff being actively pushed. But it certainly helped me come to terms with <a href="https://critter.blog/2022/06/22/normalize-the-crappy-short-blog-post/">writing crappy short blog posts</a>, and also enjoying it.

<p>
Sooner or later, the time for something worthy enough to be pushed will come again.
