I've mused about <a href="/writings/100/29.html">genres of personal websites</a> before, and I think another one that, althought they've by and large fallen out fashion, should be included are <i>E/N websites</i>.
</p>

<p>
There are two readings to the abbreviation, one is everything/nothing and the second is entertainment/news. I personally find the first interpretation more fitting, especially since second one can be subsumed under it. Sure, when folks write without any restriction about whatever is on their mind, it would be quite suprising if the news and entertainment would not make up a sizable chunk of it. After all, that stuff is popular for a reason (although, how good a reason that might be is a whole other question).

The oldest mention of the genre, that I managed to find, via JR's <a href="http://sawv.org/en.html">post about E/N sites on sawv.org</a>, is by Stuart Loh from 1999: <a href="https://www.hearye.org/1999/05/whats-an-en-site/">What's an E/N Site?</a>.
